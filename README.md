# 🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project is a basic implementation of a **handwritten digit recognizer** using the popular MNIST dataset. It classifies digits (0-9) based on grayscale image pixel data.

---

## 📌 Description

The project uses a simple neural network / machine learning model to classify handwritten digits. It's a great starting point for learning computer vision and digit classification.

---

## 🗂️ File Included

- `AI_Project.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the entire code – data loading, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

---

## 📊 Dataset Used

- **MNIST** – A dataset of 70,000 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9)
- Automatically loaded using `tensorflow.keras.datasets` or `sklearn.datasets`
